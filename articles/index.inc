* Business at lightning speed

A Lightning channel is a private connection between two parties on the Lightning Network, enabling fast and low-cost Bitcoin transactions. By allowing users to send Bitcoin back and forth without immediate blockchain recording, Lightning channels enhance transaction speed, reduce fees, and maintain privacy. This makes them ideal for microtransactions, gaming, and quick remittances, ultimately improving Bitcoin's usability for everyday transactions.
