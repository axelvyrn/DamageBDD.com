DamageBDD is a platform that unlocks the cross functional
collaborative power of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development][BDD]] (Behaviour Driven Development).

DamageBDD allows humans to define software behaviour in the human-readable
Gherkin syntax. Unlike other testing systems that require a deep
understanding of testing tools, DamageBDD enables anyone to define
expected software behaviour in plain language. This makes it easy for teams with
varying levels of technical and communication skills to collaborate
effectively towards building high quality software products.

In addition to BDD based functionality verification, DamageBDD can
also be used to test the performance and scalability of target
systems. With its ability to handle large-scale load testing,
DamageBDD can identify potential bottlenecks, stress test systems
under realistic conditions, and help organization ensure that their
applications can handle high user traffic.

Furthermore, DamageBDD can also be utilized for continuous regression
within integration and deployment pipelines. It can be integrated into
existing CI/CD workflows, allowing automated load testing to be
performed as part of the software development process. This ensures
that the performance of applications is constantly monitored and
issues are identified early on, reducing the risk of potential
performance problems in production.

DamageBDD is a powerful tool for organizations looking to improve their
testing processes and ensure the performance and scalability of their
applications.
  
*How does it work?*

Consider the simple test case below, It contains a `Feature` with
one `Scenario' which is to test that the server configured responds
with a json containing the value "ok" in the response

When this is published to the DamageBDD service, DamageBDD runners
will execute the test case at the scale configured for the run.

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<pre>
<code class="language-gherkin">
Feature: Test echo json functionality of JsonTest.com using HTTP API

  Scenario: GET request to JsonTest.com
    Given I am using server "http://echo.jsontest.com"
    When I make a GET request to "/key/value/one/two"
    Then the json at path "$.one" must be "one"
    </code>
</pre>

Other load testing systems operate at a protocol or message level and
usually requires someone with intimate understanding of load testing
tools, whereas DamageBDD test cases are human readable Behaviour
Driven Tests.
