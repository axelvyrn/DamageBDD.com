* What is DamageBDD?

DamageBDD is a platform that lets anyone – not just programmers – describe how software should behave, using simple sentences. These sentences are written in a format called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development][BDD]] (Behaviour Driven Development), which turns software testing into a conversation instead of a cryptic task only engineers understand.

Think of it like writing instructions for how an app should work, and DamageBDD automatically checks if the app really does that. This makes it possible for teams of all skill levels – developers, testers, support staff, even end users – to work together and catch problems before they reach the real world.

* Why is it powerful?

Unlike traditional testing tools that need experts and manual effort, DamageBDD:

- Uses plain language to define tests
- Works across technical and non-technical teams
- Can simulate *massive* user activity to test performance
- Works automatically inside CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Deployment) systems
- Can detect performance issues before they go live
- Enables Bitcoin-based payments for verified contributions

This means DamageBDD isn’t just about testing – it’s about *trust, transparency, and automation at scale.*

* Example

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<pre>
<code class="language-gherkin">
Feature: Test echo json functionality of JsonTest.com using HTTP API

  Scenario: GET request to JsonTest.com
    Given I am using server "http://echo.jsontest.com"
    When I make a GET request to "/key/value/one/two"
    Then the json at path "$.one" must be "one"
</code>
</pre>
#+END_EXPORT

This tells DamageBDD what to test – and it does the heavy lifting behind the scenes, checking servers, APIs, and even entire apps.

* Business Use Cases

- Web & Mobile Apps: Monitor uptime, load, and functionality
- Smart Contracts (Web3): Continuously audit decentralized apps
- Enterprise Systems: Automate QA and compliance checks
- Infrastructure Teams: Track service availability and performance
- Product Teams: Capture feature requests and real-world usage
- AI & Bots: Autogenerate tests and verify their own behavior

* Revenue Streams

- 🟠 Pay-per-Test: Users pay in Bitcoin or DAMAGE tokens to run tests at scale
- 🟢 Bug Bounties: Token rewards for contributors who define useful tests
- 🔵 DeFi Integration: Smart contracts trigger payments only when conditions are verified
- 🟡 Verification-as-a-Service: Enterprises pay for automated third-party verification
- 🟣 Token-Governed Test Market: A decentralized ecosystem where testers and developers collaborate, get paid, and build trust
