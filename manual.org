* Get Started with Behavior Testing in Minutes!

Welcome to DamageBDD, the powerful and user-friendly behavior testing platform designed to help you automate your application testing process.

In this quick start guide, we'll walk you through setting up an account, writing a simple test and running it.

*Let's dive in!* *

/[*] please read usage terms & conditions [[./tac.org][here]]/

** Create an Account

To get started with DamageBDD, you need to create an account.



You can do this by signing up using the web ui at https://run.damagebdd.com or

using the `[[https://curl.se/][curl]]` command and sending a POST request to our account creation endpoin:


#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<pre class='snippet'><code class="language-bash">
curl \
    'https://run.damagebdd.com/accounts/create' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/x-yaml' \
    -d 'email: john.doe@example.com'
</code></pre>
#+END_EXPORT
    
Check your email for a confirmation, then set up a password at the DamageBDD website. 

    
** Get a Bearer Token

Next, you need to get a bearer token by authenticating with DamageBDD:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<pre class='snippet'><code class="language-bash">
curl -X POST \
    'https://run.damagebdd.com/auth/' \
    --json '{
        "grant_type": "password",
        "username": "your damagebdd username/email",
        "password": "your damagebdd password",
        "scope": "basic"
    }'
</code></pre>
#+END_EXPORT

Store the token securely. You will use it in your future requests to DamageBDD.


Heres is an example of fetching and storing an auth token using [[https://www.passwordstore.org/][pass]] and [[https://jqlang.github.io/jq/][jq]]:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<pre class='snippet'><code class="language-bash">

export AUTH_TOKEN=$( \
    curl -sN -X POST "https://run.damagebdd.com/auth/" \
        -d "grant_type=password&username="\
        $(pass damagebdd/username)"&password="\
        $(pass damagebdd/password)"&scope=basic" \
        | jq -r '.access_token')
 
</code></pre>
#+END_EXPORT
** Quick introduction to Gherkin

Before we move on to writing a running test, here is a quick introduction to the simple Gherkin syntax that DamageBDD uses.

[[file:articles/gherkin.org][Introduction to Gherkin]]

DamageBDD contains a suite of predefined steps that you can use to create rich test cases. Configurable step aliases are a planned feature that will enable users to configure the step definition to suite the organization's vocabulary. 

[[file:steps.org][Available Steps]]

** Running a Test

Now that you have an account and a bearer token, let's write and run a simple test using Gherkin syntax:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<pre class='snippet'><code class="language-gherkin">
Feature: Http test feature
  Scenario: Test post json
    Given I am using server "https://run.damagebdd.com"
    And I set "Content-Type" header to "application/json"
    When I make a POST request to "/tests/"
    """
    {
        "echo": "test"
    }
    """
    Then the response status must be "201"
    Then the json at path "$.echo" must be "test"
</code></pre>
#+END_EXPORT

Save this test in a file called ~echotest.feature~, and then run it using `curl`:


#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<pre class='snippet'><code class="language-bash">
curl -N \
    --data-binary @features/echotest.feature \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer "$AUTH_TOKEN \
    'https://run.damagebdd.com/execute_feature'
</code></pre>
#+END_EXPORT

where ~$AUTH_TOKEN~ is the bearer token can be retrieved in the previous step.




** Authorized Domains

Domain authorization is implemented in the DamageBDD behavior testing
and load testing platform to ensure that only authorized domains can
run tests through the network. This helps maintain the security and
integrity of the network by restricting access to trusted domains.

To interact with the domain authorization feature, users can use the
following API endpoints:

*** List Domain Tokens
#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<pre class='snippet'><code class="language-bash">
curl -X GET \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer "$AUTH_TOKEN \
    https://run.damagebdd.com/accounts/domains
</code></pre>
#+END_EXPORT

*** Generate Token for Domain
#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<pre class='snippet'><code class="language-bash">
curl -X PUT \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer "$AUTH_TOKEN \
    https://run.damagebdd.com/accounts/domains --json '{"domain": "example.com"}'
</code></pre>
#+END_EXPORT
By utilizing these endpoints, users can manage and authorize domains for testing purposes effectively.

** Available Steps

Step reference can be found [[./steps.html][here.]]

To get the most current list of step implementations:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<pre class='snippet'><code class="language-bash">
curl https://run.damagebdd.com/steps.yaml
</code></pre>
#+END_EXPORT

** Reporting

To fetch the report for previous runs find the report hash of the run.

For example to fetch all reports since the last one day:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<pre class='snippet'><code class="language-bash">
curl -X POST \
    --json "{"since": "1day"}" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer "$AUTH_TOKEN \
    https://run.damagebdd.com/reports/
</code></pre>
#+END_EXPORT

Another example to query run records by result status of "success" or "failure".
This will return the run records for previous runs filtered by feature exit status.

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<pre class='snippet'><code class="language-bash">
curl -X POST \
    --json "{"since": "3hours", "status": "success"}" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer "$AUTH_TOKEN \
    https://run.damagebdd.com/reports/
</code></pre>
#+END_EXPORT

To get the list of available reports for a specific run use the report hash


#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<pre class='snippet'><code class="language-bash">
REPORT_HASH="REPORT_HASH"
curl \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer "$AUTH_TOKEN \
    https://run.damagebdd.com/reports/$REPORT_HASH/
</code></pre>
#+END_EXPORT

To get a specific report in a report hash, get ~<DAMAGE_PID>~ from the above list output 

    
#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<pre class='snippet'><code class="language-bash">
DAMAGE_PID="PID"
REPORT_HASH="REPORT_HASH"
curl \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer "$AUTH_TOKEN \
    https://run.damagebdd.com/reports/$REPORT_HASH/$DAMAGE_PID.color.txt
</code></pre>
#+END_EXPORT


** Scheduling

*** Create a repeating scheduled run


#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<pre class='snippet'><code class="language-bash">
curl -N \
    --data-binary @features/damage_http.feature \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer "$AUTH_TOKEN \
    'https://run.damagebdd.com/schedule/daily/every/10/sec
</code></pre>
#+END_EXPORT

*** List schedules

To list all the scheduled jobs for a user.

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<pre class='snippet'><code class="language-bash">
curl -N \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer "$AUTH_TOKEN \
    'https://run.damagebdd.com/schedule/
</code></pre>
#+END_EXPORT
*** Delete schedules

To delete a scheduled job, use the id from the listing in the following request

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<pre class='snippet'><code class="language-bash">
curl -v -N \
    -X DELETE
    -H "Authorization: Bearer "$AUTH_TOKEN \
    'https://run.damagebdd.com/schedule/${SCHEDULE_ID}/
</code></pre>
#+END_EXPORT

** Localhost Testing Tunnel

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html

<div style="border: 1px solid #333; padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0; background-color: #f9f9f9;">
  <i>
Experimental Feature
</i>
</div>
#+END_EXPORT

To run tests on localhost using DamageBDD, you can utilize the ssh
reverse tunneling feature. Please note that this feature is currently
in the experimental phase.

To set up the tunnel, follow these steps:

1. Make a POST request to https://run.damagebdd.com/tunnels/ with the following parameters:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<pre class='snippet'><code class="language-bash">
DAMAGE_TUNNEL_START=$(curl \
    -X POST -D "{
  "local_port": 8080,
  "pub_key": "$SSH_PUBLIC_KEY"
}"\
    -H "Authorization: Bearer "$AUTH_TOKEN \
    https://run.damagebdd.com/tunnels/)|jq -r '.tunnel_start_port')
</code></pre>

#+END_EXPORT


2. Once the request is successful, use the ssh client to establish the tunnel by running the following command:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<pre class='snippet'><code class="language-bash">
DAMAGE_SSH_SERVER_PORT=8989
LOCAL_SERVER_PORT=8080

ssh -x run.damagebdd.com \
    -p 8989 \
    -L $DAMAGE_TUNNEL_START:localhost:$LOCAL_SERVER_PORT
</code></pre>
#+END_EXPORT


You now have a tunnel set up from the damagebdd server to your server
running on localhost. Any tests you submit that refer to ~localhost~
will be executed against the localhost server through this tunnel.

Please note that this feature is still being refined, and it may
undergo changes and improvements. If you encounter any issues or have
any feedback, please let us know.


** Integrations

*** Webhooks

**** List Webhooks

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<pre class='snippet'><code class="language-bash">
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer "$AUTH_TOKEN \
    'https://run.damagebdd.com/webhooks' | jq 
</code></pre>
#+END_EXPORT

**** Add Webhook

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
